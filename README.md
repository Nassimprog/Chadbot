Quick brief: This project presents fully functional discord bot specialized in cooking. Users benefit from a broad range of functionalities such as: 

- Looking up recipes from the Edamam API database, allowing for use of simple ingredients or full sentences (contains sentence recognition). 
(command keyword in discord = ".recipe")
- Finding locations where you can dine and enjoy your meals using Google Places API. (command keyword in discord = ".location")
- Getting nutritional information about individual food components using Edamam API. (command keyword in discord = ".nutrition") 
- Looking up a cocktail recipe based on your desired ingredient using Rapid API. (command keyword in discord = ".cocktailIngredient")
  - Looking up direct recipes is also an option but it still needs integration to discord bot.
- Getting random recipe allows you to randomly well not choose but get one of the recipes in the database. (command = ".surprise")

How to use: 
1. Download/Save the folders altogether.
2. Open the command prompt and install the following: pip install discord...
3. Open ChadBot.py file in any of your favorite IDEs(we used VS code 2019).
4. You will need to modify the Discord Bot key to fit your bot. (we will also exclude all of the other keys used in the other APIs so you will need to get your own ones at their websites. In regarding files we provide you with links to documentation where you can find out about them.)
5. Run the file, when you see "Bot ready." in your terminal in your IDE you can start using the bot in your Discord. (The bot will be online in your Discord, this way you know he is ready to answer your hot questions/inquiries.).


Note: If you decide to use/inspire yourself using our group's project don't forget to leave a reference to us as we did to the people we got inspired from. :}  ~ Hope it helped, Tom.
